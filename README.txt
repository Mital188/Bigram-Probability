Programming Language and Compiler
----------------------

-Python3.0
-Pycharm3 edu

----------------------
To compile the code
----------------------

a) Copy pate the NLP.py python file and text.txt text file in the window

b) Run the program as sentence is included in the program

In command line 
NLP.py

- Just the file name is sufficient, the code reads from the corpus directly
- Corpus name (text.txt), to be kept in the same folder as the source code

----------------------
OutPut
----------------------

a) Bigram Count of Corpus

b) Bigram Count for Sentence-1

c) Bigram Count for Sentence-2

d) Bigram Probabilities for Sentence-2

e) Bigram Probabilities for Sentence-1

f) Total Probability for Sentence-1

g) Total Probability for Sentence-2

----------------------
Matrix format
----------------------
- Unique Count of sentences is taken into account
- Sentences fed to the code manually
- Unable to print the labels but the matrix format was to be as follows
